Welcome to KUWoC! This guide will help you get started with contributing to the participating organizations' projects.

## Understanding KUWoC Contributions

KUWoC is a 2-month long program where you contribute to open-source projects from participating organizations. Your contributions help real-world projects while you learn and grow as a developer.

## Finding Projects

Visit the [Organizations](/organizations) page to browse all participating organizations and their projects. Each organization has different focus areas, tech stacks, and contribution opportunities.

## Before You Start

:::caution[Read Organization Guidelines]
**Each organization has their own contribution guidelines.** Before making any contributions, you must:
- Read the organization's specific contributing guidelines thoroughly
- Understand their code of conduct
- Follow their development workflow
- Respect their coding standards and conventions
:::

### What to Look For

When exploring an organization's repository, check for:

- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Detailed contribution guidelines
- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - Community standards and expectations
- **README.md** - Project overview and setup instructions
- **Issues labeled** `good-first-issue`, `junior-job`,`good-first-pr` - Great starting points
- **Pull request templates** - Required format for submissions

## General Contribution Workflow

While each organization may have specific requirements, here's a typical workflow:

### 1. Choose a Project

Browse the [Organizations](/organizations) page and pick a project that:
- Matches your interests and skills
- Has clear documentation
- Has open issues you can work on

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub

# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PROJECT_NAME.git

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORGANIZATION/PROJECT_NAME.git

# Install dependencies (check project README)
npm install  # or yarn, pip, etc.
```

### 3. Find an Issue

- Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue`, `kuwoc`, `help-wanted`, or `beginner-friendly`
- Read the issue description carefully
- Comment on the issue to express your interest before starting work
- Wait for maintainer approval if required

### 4. Make Your Changes

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# Write clean, documented code
# Follow the organization's style guide

# Test your changes thoroughly
npm test  # or the project's test command

# Commit with clear messages
git commit -m "Add: feature description"
```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Open a pull request on GitHub
# Fill out the PR template completely
# Reference the issue you're addressing
# Provide clear description of your changes
```

### 6. Respond to Feedback

- Maintainers may request changes
- Respond promptly and professionally
- Make requested changes and push updates
- Engage in constructive discussion

## Types of Contributions

You can contribute in many ways:

- **Code:** Bug fixes, new features, performance improvements
- **Documentation:** Improving README, tutorials, API docs
- **Testing:** Writing tests, reporting bugs, testing features

## Best Practices

### Communication

- Be respectful and professional
- Ask questions when unclear
- Provide context in your issues and PRs
- Respond to maintainer feedback promptly

### Code Quality

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the project's coding conventions
- Add comments where necessary
- Include tests for new features
- Keep commits atomic and well-described

### Before Submitting

-  Test your changes thoroughly
-  Update documentation if needed
-  Follow the organization's commit message format
-  Ensure your code passes all tests
-  Rebase on latest upstream if needed

## Getting Help

If you're stuck or have questions:

1. **Check the organization's documentation** - Most answers are there
2. **Search existing issues** - Someone may have asked before
3. **Ask in the issue comments** - Maintainers are there to help
4. **Join community channels** - Discord, Slack, or other platforms
5. **Reach out to KUWoC organizers** - For program-related questions

## Important Reminders

:::note[Organization-Specific Rules]
Every organization is different. Always prioritize their specific guidelines over this general guide. When in doubt, ask the maintainers!
:::

:::tip[Quality Over Quantity]
Focus on making meaningful contributions rather than numerous small ones. A well-thought-out PR is more valuable than many rushed ones.
:::

:::caution[Respect Maintainers' Time]
Maintainers are often volunteers. Be patient, follow their guidelines, and make their job easier by submitting high-quality, well-documented contributions.
